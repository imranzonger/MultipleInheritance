# MultipleInheritance
Use interfaces to implement multiple inheritance

A class is inherited from multiple interfaces, in interface all methods are used, they are by default public and abstract.

previous code is made better by using interfaces, loose coupling, plug and play, and multiple inheritance is achieved,

previously we were stuck by abstract class and can not use multiple inheritance.
